===============================

Example of server-side rendering of flux hello world application using Nashorn.

# Nashorn

Nashorn is Javaâ€™s embedded JavaScript engine that comes part of Java 8.  Nashorn will compile JavaScript to Java bytecode providing interoperability between Java and JavaScript code.  

This repo demonstrates running server-side render of a react component using Java.  It uses maven and spring-boot to compile and launch an embedded web server (but, in general, these are not required for doing server-side rendering of reactJS components using Nashorn)

# Isomorphic Flux

"Isomorphic JavaScript" describes JS applications that run on both the client and the server. 

This takes the hello world flux application from [ssr-demo-kit](https://github.com/zertosh/ssr-demo-kit) by Andres Suarez and renders it server-side using Nashorn.

# Installation instructions

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
```

To run:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then go to: http://localhost:8080/

To turn off server-side rendering, pass _ssr_ parameter as _false_:

http://localhost:8080/?ssr=false
